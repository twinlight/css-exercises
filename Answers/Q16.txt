Transaction Control Language (TCL) statements are used to manage transactions in a database. Transactions are sequences of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. TCL commands are used to ensure that transactions are processed reliably and maintain database integrity. The key TCL statements are COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.

1. COMMIT Statement

The COMMIT statement is used to save all the changes made during the current transaction. Once a commit is issued, all changes are permanently applied to the database.

Example:
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Insert some records
INSERT INTO Employees (Employee_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Department, Salary, Hire_Date)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'HR', 50000.00, '2024-07-01');

INSERT INTO Employees (Employee_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Department, Salary, Hire_Date)
VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'IT', 60000.00, '2024-07-02');

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;


2. ROLLBACK Statement

The ROLLBACK statement is used to undo changes made during the current transaction. This will revert the database to the state it was in before the transaction began.

Example:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Insert some records
INSERT INTO Employees (Employee_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Department, Salary, Hire_Date)
VALUES (3, 'Alice', 'Johnson', 'Marketing', 55000.00, '2024-07-03');

INSERT INTO Employees (Employee_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Department, Salary, Hire_Date)
VALUES (4, 'Bob', 'Brown', 'Finance', 70000.00, '2024-07-04');

-- Rollback the transaction
ROLLBACK;



3. SAVEPOINT Statement
The SAVEPOINT statement is used to set a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back. This allows partial rollback within a transaction.

Example:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Insert some records
INSERT INTO Employees (Employee_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Department, Salary, Hire_Date)
VALUES (5, 'Charlie', 'Davis', 'HR', 52000.00, '2024-07-05');

-- Set a savepoint
SAVEPOINT sp1;

-- Make some more changes
INSERT INTO Employees (Employee_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Department, Salary, Hire_Date)
VALUES (6, 'Diana', 'Evans', 'IT', 62000.00, '2024-07-06');

-- Rollback to the savepoint
ROLLBACK TO sp1;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;




Using TCL statements helps to ensure data integrity and consistency in complex transactions and is essential for handling errors and managing changes in a controlled manner.
