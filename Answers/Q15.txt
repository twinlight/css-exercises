Data Definition Language (DDL) statements are used to define and manage the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. Hereâ€™s a demonstration of common DDL statements including CREATE, ALTER, and DROP with examples.

1. CREATE Statement
The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects.

Example 1: Create a Table

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    Employee_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    First_Name VARCHAR(50),
    Last_Name VARCHAR(50),
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Hire_Date DATE
);


2. ALTER Statement
The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object.

Example 1: Add a Column

ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD Email VARCHAR(100);


3. DROP Statement
The DROP statement is used to delete database objects.

Example 1: Drop a Table

DROP TABLE Employees;


These DDL statements allow you to define and manage the structure of your database effectively, ensuring that your schema fits the requirements of your application.
